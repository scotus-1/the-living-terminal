Dear

I am writing underneath a statue of the Largest Viking in the World in Gimli, Manitoba. The wind is cold and water stretches out in front of me for ever and for ever. It is something beautiful and something almost too good to be meant for me. I hope you get to see it someday, but no time soon. Wait for thaw and think of me.
